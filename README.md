This project required me to create a class that contained a series of ten methods that could perform various math operations. I then had to create a user interface that would allow the user to select a specific task by typing a number from the menu. Certain tasks would ask for certain types of input from the user, which would then return a result for the user.This program can be used by simply starting the program and typing a number form the menu.
